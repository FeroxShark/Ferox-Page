# Ferox Page

This repository contains a small personal page built with React. The content configuration lives in `js/app.js` and is rendered at runtime. Static assets reside under `img/` and styling is provided via Tailwind CSS.

The site follows a mobileâ€‘first approach and includes a responsive navigation menu. Real User Monitoring is integrated using the Web Vitals API.

## Footer year

The footer displays the current year dynamically using `new Date().getFullYear()` directly in the React component. The `initializeFooterYear()` function remains as a no-op placeholder for any future footer logic.
